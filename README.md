## Goal

The goal of FishMIP’s “Fish Futures” Protocol is to assess adaptation
pathways to climate change under different societal and fisheries
management development pathways. This simulation round extends our
previous CMIP6 climate impact projections to include past and future
fisheries development to enable us to identify key risks and adaptation
to climate change including consequences for biodiversity, fisheries and
food security.

The future scenarios we are using have been developed to be consistent
with each of the [Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways](https://www.climateforesight.eu/seeds/shared-socioeconomic-pathways/),
but with explicit additional details needed for fisheries and
aquaculture development, are called Ocean System Pathways (OSPs) (Maury
et al. 2023 - TO BE SUBMITTED).

This protocol provides details on the experimental set-up and data
forcings required to run each of these scenarios, with and without
climate change.

Note that this protocol builds on the FishMIP’s [“CMIP6” Phase
1](https://github.com/Fish-MIP/FishMIP_2023_3b_Protocol/blob/main/FishMIP_Phase1_2020_CMIP6_runs_protocol_v1.0.pdf)
protocol which focused primarily on results without fishing, for
fast-track inclusion in the IPCC 6th Assessment. Modellers are welcome
to redo previous Phase 1 runs with new versions of their models that
have had improvements following the FishMIP [“Model
Evaluation”](https://github.com/Fish-MIP/FishMIP_2022_3a_Protocol)
protocol round.

Timelines for simulations: TO BE DISCUSSED

| Scenarios                     | Models           | Date          |
|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Historical (See Table X)      | global, regional | July 1st 2024 |
| OSPs (See Table X)            | global, regional | Oct 1st, 2024 |
| Additional runs (See Table X) | global           |               |

To aid with progress we will hold specific technical workshops to:

- Ensure correct OSP integration inputs and access

- Ensure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway
  groups)

- Tool sharing & troubleshooting

- Check model outputs/issues

In this document we describe the general experimental and scenario
set-up (Section 3). Further down in Section 4 we include the details of
the specific **input** variables that modellers can use to implement
scenarios. In Section 5 we describe the set of **outputs** to be
created. Finally in Sections 6-7 we provide further **notes** and
**instructions** on how to report and upload model results.

This protocal is a contribution to the wider Inter-Sectoral Model
Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3b) simulation round, further details can
be found here:

[https://protocol.isimip.org/#ISIMIP3b/marine-fishery_regional/marine-fishery_global](https://protocol.isimip.org/)

**For this simulation round, we are asking you to run XXXXXXXX**

## Experiments & Scenarios

Each model experiment is a set of model simulations that has a
particular goal (e.g. model evaluation). A scenario is a particular
setting for forcing drivers that describes how each model run should be
set up in the experiment, including both the type of climate forcing
(CF) and the type of direct human forcing (DHF). All model runs are to
be carried out using each Earth System Model ().

**Modellers that have already completed Phase 1 runs can skip to Phase 2
below, unless they wish to update runs based on improvements since the
Model Evaluation simulation round. Please prioritize the core ‘priority’
runs below, and provide the ‘optional’ if possible.**

##### Table 1: Control run and historical simulation experimental set-up. Note that each simulation is specified by the Climate forcing and Fishing forcing. Definitions of the specifiers (e.g. nat, picontrol etc.) that are used for ISIMIP filenaming are provided in Tables 3 and 4 below.

#### Note on spin-up period (pre-1850)

For fishing effort prior to 1850 hold fishing at 1850 levels.  
  
For the ‘no fishing’ runs (nat), the spin-up should not use any fishing
effort.

#### Scenario definitions

Throughout the protocol we use ‘specifiers’ that are shortened names
used to denote a particular scenario, variables, or other parameter in
the filenames of model inputs and outputs. It is crucial that you also
use the same specifiers in your output files.  
  
**Correct formatting and naming of output files are essential for model
intercomparison and analysis.**  
  
Tables 2-4 describe the different scenarios for the model runs described
in Table 1. These specifiers are used in the file names of the
corresponding input files and should also be used for the names of the
output files (see 
[7](https://protocol.isimip.org/#reporting-model-results). Reporting
model results).

**Please remember to use these same specifiers in your output files.
More on reporting data can be found at the end of this document.**

## Input data

**For modellers new to FishMIP:** to access all input data you first
need to set up an account with ISIMIP to access the DKRZ server. Please

### Climate forcing file locations

The climate forcing input files can be found using the following
pattern:

``` linux
levante:/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3b/InputData/climate/ocean/uncorrected/<glob
al or regional>/monthly/<climate-scenario>/<climate-forcing>/<climateforcing>_<ensemble-member>_<climate-scenario>_<climatevariable>_global_monthly_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc
```

The variables **deptho** and **thkcello** are fixed through time and can
be found in the “fixed/” folder (rather than monthly/).

#### Note on phytoplankton size structure inputs

Production and carbon data for large and small phytoplankton can be
derived from the variables in Table 1 by the following:

large = diatoms + diazotrophs

small = picophytoplankton

The GFDL model treats diazotrophs as large phytoplankton as part of
their food-web processes.

#### Note on regional model spatial extractions

For regional models, only specific grid cells will be needed from the
above global outputs. Please let us know if you require assistance to
extract results (e.g. using bounding boxes, masks or shapefiles). This
functionality is now partially available (bounding box) through the
ISIMIP web-based [data portal](https://data.isimip.org/).

A simple worked example on how to do this for specific regions in R is
provided here: <https://github.com/Fish-MIP/FishMIP_extracting-data>

#### Implementation of OSPs

TO DO: We provide code examples showing how to implement the OSPs… NEED
TO ADD TO GITHUB REPO

##### Table 8: Metadata for fishing effort variables.

#### Fishing effort forcing file locations

The monthly fishing effort forcing files for the spin-up and experiments
(Table 1) of this simulation protocol can be found on DKRZ here:

``` linux
levante:/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3b/InputData/socioeconomic/fishing/histsoc/
```

#### Note on global model fishing effort forcing

For **global models**, the above spatially aggregated fishing effort can
be spatially allocated into 0.25 grid cells. This can be achieved using
different approaches such as a simple gravity model – e.g. see [Coll et
al. 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567877/full)
but details will depend on model structure.

We are developing a simplified worked example for global modellers to
explore and contribute to. This will be made available on github/FishMIP
in due course.

While we recommend using the above spatially aggregated effort, for
**global models** that cannot technically carry out spatial allocation
of effort, gridded total industrial and artisanal nominal active effort
have been provided in the same folder as the file above and are saved as
netcdf files. These can be allocated to functional groups
(e.g. according to relative biomass) depending on model structure.

#### Note on regional model fishing effort forcing

Downscaling of the above fishing effort to match regional model inputs
is likely to be needed. We request that regional modellers work together
in their specific regions to ensure we have clear and common
methodologies.

We are developing a worked example for regional modellers to explore and
contribute to for their region which will be made available on
github/FishMIP in due course.

#### Note on model calibration using fishing catch data and model evaluation requirements

Modellers are permitted to calibrate or tune their models using
historical fisheries catch data (that will also be used for model
evaluation) on the condition that **only years up to and including
2004** are used in model calibration/tuning.

Modelling groups **must** keep **detailed documentation** on how their
model was calibrated (e.g. input forcing, calibration data, time domain,
spatial domain, fish grouping (size, functional types, total),
optimization metric(s), weighting schemes, etc.) to be included in
manuscript methods. Written description of sources of calibration data
and methods used need to be provided with all simulation outputs. A
template will be provided for this documentation in due course.

The fisheries catch data .csv file that can be used for model
calibration is here:

``` linux
levante:/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/socioeconomic/fishing/histsoc/calibration_catch_histsoc_1850_2004.csv.
```

The fisheries catch data are already aggregated into the functional
groups and spatial zones as the above effort forcing data. The original
reference including links to full database is [Watson & Tidd, 2018,
Marine Policy, 93:
171-177](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18300605).

### **Other static geographic information**:

Large marine ecosystem (LME) masks in four different spatial
resolutions. 0.1°, 0.25°, 0.5° and 1° are available here:

``` linux
/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/geo_conditions/fishmip_regions/
```

Each region has its own variable within each file.

We have also provided conversion tables that can be used to look up LME
and SAUP names according to the numeric codes used in the catch and
effort files (e.g. LME 22 – North Sea). These files (SAUPnames.csv and
LMEnames.csv) are also available here:

``` linux
/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/geo_conditions/fishmip_regions/
```

## Output data

All spatially gridded outputs should be created as netcdf files. More
information on how to prepare these files can be found
[here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files).
Aspatial regional model results may be saved as .csv files.

In the output files, please label the time variable as “days since
1841-1-1 00:00:00” if the output covers the spin-up and transition
period (1841-1960) or “days since 1901-1-1 00:00:00” if the output
covers the experiment period (1961-2010).

## Additional notes for Regional FishMIP Models

More specific protocols for each regional model type will be developed
through our monthly online regional modeller sessions. Please contact
regional FishMIP coordinators for more information.

As a first step, regional modellers will need to provide shapefiles for
their respective model domains for us to help with spatial extraction of
the above global climate and fishing effort forcing inputs.

Region-specific climate forcing variables will be made available here:

``` linux
/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/ocean/<obsclim> or <ctrlclim>/regional/
```

A .csv file with fishing effort extracted for regional model ecosystems
is also available in the same folder as the global fishing effort data
(`../fishing/histsoc`), for regional models that have provided
shapefiles.

Regional modellers may wish to make their raw unaggregated output
available for more detailed analyses, including for example, a wider
range of functional groups/size classes/species and ecosystem
indicators. Please discuss this with FishMIP regional coordinators
before uploading files.

## Reporting model results

The specification on how to submit the data, as well as further
information and instructions are given on the ISIMIP website at:

<https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files>

**It is important that you comply precisely with the formatting
specified there**, to facilitate the analysis of your simulation results
in the ISIMIP framework. Incorrect formatting can seriously delay
analyses. The ISIMIP Team will be glad to assist with the preparation of
these files if necessary.

File names consist of a series of identifier, separated by underscores.
Things to note:

- Report one variable per file.

- In filenames, use lowercase letters only.

- Use underscore (\_) to separate identifiers.

- Variable names consist of a single word without hyphens or
  underscores.

- Use hyphens (-) to separate strings within an identifier, e.g. in a
  model name.

- Data model is NETCDF4_CLASSIC with minimum compression level of 5.

- NetCDF file extension is .nc.

- The relative time axis’ reference date is days since 1841-1-1 00:00:00
  if the output covers the spin-up and transition period (1841-1960) or
  days since 1901-1-1 00:00:00 if the output covers the experiment
  period (1961-2010). We have provided .csv files to be used for the
  time dimension in creating NetCDF files based on the 365 days
  calendar. Please see time_axix_spinup.csv and time_axis_experiment.csv
  in this repository. The script time_axis.r was used to create these
  files.

### Name pattern of output files:

Please name the files in the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems sector
according to the following pattern:

**Global models**

``` linux
<model>_<climate-forcing>_<bias-adjustment>_<climate-scenario>_<soc-scenario>_<sens-scenario>_<variable>_<global>_<time-step>_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc
```

Example:

``` linux
boats_gfdl-mom6_cobalt2_none_obsclim_histsoc_default_tcb_global_monthly_1961_2010.nc
```

**Regional models**

``` linux
